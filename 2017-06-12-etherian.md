- Vitalik on the limits of sharding techology (with some formatting edits):
 >"First of all, quadratic sharding by itself doesn't seem to provide enough of an efficiency gain. This is basically because you need to have quite a lot of signatures on each shard to mitigate risk of attack, and those signatures may be expensive. So we'd need to go to tree-style almost immediately. There is another nice way to do it: have a binary tree where each leaf in the tree has three nodes: (shard, left, right), then you can even uncap the depth. Second, with data unavailability proofs, the main challenge right now seems to be that I'm not yet sure how to do fault assignment unless there is one guy creating and signing the proof for an entire block. (Entire block = including all shards, sub shards, etc). I.e. the thing that I'm not sure how to do is creating a proof of data availability that can be verified as a single proof, with the overhead of a single proof, but where multiple nodes can collaborate on creating the proof, and if there is malfeasance then you know whom to blame. This seems worth thinking about at the IC3 workshop. Well ok, one thing we know we can use is starks, but that's still esoteric and far away, maybe starks for ethereum 3.0 or 4.0."
- Vitalik Buterin:
 >"Thought of an interesting and principled way to penalize logged off validators. Basically, penalize them as though they have the average behavior of the entire [online] set. So if you have 3/4 online-or-censoring and 1/4 offline-or-victims then penalize each logged out validator with 0.75 x penalty to larger group + 0.25 x penalty to smaller group."
