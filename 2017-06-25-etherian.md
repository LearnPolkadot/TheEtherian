##### [Digix](https://digix.io/) – Asset (Gold) Backed Tokens
- Succinct summary of how DigixDAO intends to function from @souleye:
  >"First, proposals (suggestions) are drafted and discussed. Then they're encoded into a smart contract - our governance contract (not released yet) - wherein we vote on the options we have previously discussed. Anyone holding DGDs will be able to vote, and his voting power will be how many DGD he holds. When an option is chosen, the pre-agreed amount of funds are released to the party we voted for, according to the proposal. Could be marketing, coding, support for another project... The DAO (which is us) will decide."
