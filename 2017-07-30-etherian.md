- jperkinsx asks: "Will there be a 'target supply' of MKR once dai is launched?"
- > nik: The MKR supply is 1M. The only way that goes up and down is through minting of new MKR to cover underwater CDPs or buy and burn from CDP fees. There is no "target" quantity, the quantity is merely a measure of how well the system is being run.
- Nearly ready to launch [new site](https://ferni.github.io/makerdai.org/)!

- Christian Lundkvist:
  >The "unable to verify JWT" happens when the app can't find your profile data on IPFS. Try updating your profile picture and wait a bit, this should refresh. If that doesn't work you may need to recreate your identity from scratch.
- Christian Lundkvist:
  >In general you can use uport-connect to request the user to disclose things. They way the disclosure is made is by signing a "response", so this also doubles as an authentication mechanism. We are in the process of making this more secure, should be done within a couple weeks or so (but you can still play around with it)
