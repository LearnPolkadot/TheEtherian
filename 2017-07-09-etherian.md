Great progress has been made on the general dapp architecture and on the UX/UI side of things. We have also started working on the MVP for our first token proposal and on a fully functional Web version of AKASHA.

The AKASHA beta will basically be a new dapp, rewritten from scratch, applying all the insights gained during the alpha. By the look of things, we anticipate the beta release somewhere around Q3-Q4.

Among other things, the beta release seeks to stress test the entire dapp architecture and its limits in an attempt to see how the infrastructure behaves (Ethereum/Whisper/IPFS/SWARM) with thousands of active users and transactions.

With the latest round of smart contracts refactoring, Marius managed to minimize the on-chain footprint even further and we seek to understand from this release how the dapp will fit into the whole Ethereum network in anticipation of the main network launch.
